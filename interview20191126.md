### The third interview was more about the company. The interviewer talked a lot about the culture and the products, and said that he wanted to know what I could say about me that fitted their culture. Sounded more of a behavioral interview.
### The last interview was with the first person that I talked on the phone. It was more like a formal interview about the company, shw talked more about it's products and culture, asked me about some questions of how could I see myself in the company.
### How could I find the common Node of two simple linked lists with the minimum complexity?

### Some basic javascript questions like hoisting, event loops, scope etc, then asked me to write/implement debounce.
### BFS in a matrix  
### Given an infinite amount of resources, how can you  determine which build of software caused a problem?
* I had several answers that were OK and would have worked, but the idea was about creating a binary search of the range of builds.
### When's a time you had to be creative when solving a coding problem?  
### class vs object  
Class	| Object
----- | ------
A class is a blueprint from which you can create the instance, i.e., objects.	| An object is the instance of the class, which helps programmers to use variables and methods from inside the class.
A class is used to bind data as well as methods together as a single unit.	| object acts as a variable of the class.
Classes have logical existence.	| Objects have a physical existence.
A class doesn't take any memory spaces when a programmer creates one.	| An object takes memory when a programmer creates one.
The class has to be declared only once.	| Objects can be declared several times depending on the requirement.

c. Junit -> This was very difficult and unusual section. He basically provides this really length code and asks you to design Junit Tests for it. You don’t even know much about the code. Basically, try to prove that an assertion will be triggered and then more …

### Design a system that represents an API that has the requirements:
-store phone numbers
-give a new number(randomly)
-requests a specific number  

### Write a basic login form that talks to an API and redirects based on the response. Re-write or update the HTML form using jQuery and a single HTML page (SPA w/o a framework).  
### Write a tree view list component that can be reused.  
### Implement basic components/elements using an SPA framework of your choice (React, Vue, Angular, etc..).  
### 3. Given a tile class, where each tile knows: the tile to the east, north, west, and south, along with whether it is a golden tile or not. Tiles are laid out in a large square (of unknown size), and there is only 1 golden tile. You start at one tile within the sqare (unknown) and need to find a path to the golden tile (list directions of east/south/north/west, in order).  

### Given an Animal class, implement a function that will output all animals organized by group.  
### Given any number greater than 2, implement a function that will find the two prime numbers that sum to that number.  
### Group similar objects within an array

1. valid string anagram 要求O(n)的时间复杂度
2. golden tile problem 这题有点难度
类似迷宫，定义每个格子tile 只有一个boolean 成员变量 isGolden 每个格子只能朝四个方向up down left right 移动到下一个tile。然后这个迷宫中有一个tile 被标记为isGolden=true 要你找到从起始tile 到这个终点的一条路径
follow up:
寻找最短的路径（移动步骤最少）
没有坐标可以使用，也不能修改tile定义。
我的做法就是dfs 加 一个set记录去过的tile的hash。 follow up的话我就说了改成bfs 但没时间写。

什麼是static, string vs stringbuffer vs stringbuilder, constructor, set vs list 這種
