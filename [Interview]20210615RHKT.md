60. Initial 2 rounds of questions are in LinkedLists, sockets, Queues and strings, as i am from object oriented background i wrote code in C++, but they said work will be in C. So i took procedural approach to solve the problems

Interview Questions
Program on socket where sender will send packets in zigzag manner and receiver needs to put the packets in order and then process them.
61. Questions about: Java language keywords, Java collections, design patterns, thread safety, JEE 3 tier model, database architecture, web architecture. The questions were tricky, but the interviewer was supportive. It was 20 min intense Q&A.
3. I was invited to onsite technical interview with international team members, using video conference (english spoken). The project was reviewed and I was asked a design question to solve a problem. When I solved the problem they added more complexity. It was simple question slowly evolving to complex server side multi-threaded database solution. It was intense experience the interviewers are sharp and experience engineers.
4. I was invited to hands-on Java test, with one of the interviewers. The test was about learning existing frizzed code, and extending it with additional functionality. Then it followed with an intense deep dive technical interview into the deep and dark corners of Java. Much deeper then the phone interview. I felt great professional respect to the interviewer, and I felt he respected me too.


What is REST and SOAP and explain the difference
Describe one thing that demonstrated you are a determined person


# A design solution to their current trucking’ problem.

* given an array filter out duplicates in javascript

* More of system design discussion

* Verbally say code for traversal of BST.

*  lru caching 

*  sorted lists

* Generate all the possible IP addresses from a given string.


* Goat Latin

* what are closures in Javascript

* What is best to do to avoid being the single point of failure?

1. coding: given a list of digits, construct all the possible valid IP addresses by adding dots to different positions. 用backtracking做的，不难。
2. Design: Desgin an uber, 侧重data model的design，如何partition data, 如何balance load，各个backend components 如何交互。

午饭， 瞎聊一会儿。

3. Design: design a data pipline that collect and store different data coming from different sensors on trucks, 本质就是要求设计一个能够存储大量streaming data的系统，我和面试官讨论都是high level的components，比如用Kafka来queue不同的data log，如何利用spark做aggragation什么的。
4. Coding: given a list of sorted interger lists, find the smallest integer appearing in all lists.  
5. Hiring Manager: 一些behavior, 还有一些brainstorm，比如怎么从卡车dashcam的900帧图片里跳出最有价值的100帧图片，就是想一些heuristic来给图片计算出一个rank，其实这轮主要是在瞎扯。

每轮面试官都很友好，没有刻意刁难。
