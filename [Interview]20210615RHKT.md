59. How does kdump work?
60. Initial 2 rounds of questions are in LinkedLists, sockets, Queues and strings, as i am from object oriented background i wrote code in C++, but they said work will be in C. So i took procedural approach to solve the problems

Interview Questions
Program on socket where sender will send packets in zigzag manner and receiver needs to put the packets in order and then process them.
61. Questions about: Java language keywords, Java collections, design patterns, thread safety, JEE 3 tier model, database architecture, web architecture. The questions were tricky, but the interviewer was supportive. It was 20 min intense Q&A.
3. I was invited to onsite technical interview with international team members, using video conference (english spoken). The project was reviewed and I was asked a design question to solve a problem. When I solved the problem they added more complexity. It was simple question slowly evolving to complex server side multi-threaded database solution. It was intense experience the interviewers are sharp and experience engineers.
4. I was invited to hands-on Java test, with one of the interviewers. The test was about learning existing frizzed code, and extending it with additional functionality. Then it followed with an intense deep dive technical interview into the deep and dark corners of Java. Much deeper then the phone interview. I felt great professional respect to the interviewer, and I felt he respected me too.
